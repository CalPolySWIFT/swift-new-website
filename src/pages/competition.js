            Students with an Interest in
            the Future of Technology is the premier information technology and
            security organization at Cal Poly Pomona. We aim to inspire and
            create a generation of students who are aware and capable of dealing
            with the dynamic landscape of information security, cyber security,
            and information technology. Together we can build a secure future
            through training, experience, and education.

              CCDC is a national blue teaming competition that challenges student to maintain 
              and protect a simulated corporation. CCDC challenges a variety of skills, 
              maintaining a companyâ€™s day-to-day operations, managing networks, 
              and hardening main services in Linux and Windows. 
              Many industries recognize CCDC as real world technical experience. 
              To prepare, SWIFT invites all students for weekly CCDC training starting summer 
              till the end of nationals.

              CPTC is a national red teaming competition that challenges students to penetrate and attack by exploiting vulnerabilities 
              in order to extract as much damaging information as possible. SWIFT provides training 
              in both areas of securing and penetrating corporations; 
              with an understanding of both practices, we hope students will thrive in the competition 
              as well as the real world. SWIFT has been a huge supporter in all cybersecurity competitions, 
              absorbing the same expenses for our CPTC competitors as CCDC.

            Red vs. Blue (RvB) is a SWIFT-run competition that enables its teams 
            competing in CCDC and CPTC to share their technical knowledge and expertise 
            with other students. RvB is modeled after CCDC and places a team of 4 students 
            into a vulnerable network they have to protect. SWIFT board and alumni act as 
            an adversary trying to compromise the network and give students a unique 
            experience of troubleshooting and incident response in an active breach 
            scenario. Originating from a partnership between SWIFT and Troy High School, 
            we aim to expand this opportunity for SWIFT members and give the competition 
            experience into everyone's hands.
